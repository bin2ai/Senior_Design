This is what I’m hoping to accomplish.
- $$$ we double check that I made the necessary changes to the schematic from your review
- we quickly scan through the rest of the schematic, and any changes that were made
- we go over component associated footprints and start building a BOM that accurately describes the footprints selected. 
- we discuss component placement to maximize effectiveness of our design. That means also going through data sheets for suggested layout design for the regulators etc.
- we add test points/solder bridges to necessary locations
- we add silk screen text for debugging purposes
- then I finalize the PCB by connecting the traces. (edited)
I have an exam tomorrow so I’m going to have to take a break on the pcb until then. But just to add to our discussion tomorrow, I think I have an unnecessary button for the Bluetooth module and the footprint size of some components like the shunt resistor May be too small. (edited)
I’ll teach you guys how to go through mouser for selecting components.

noticed that TX1 and RX1 are connected to the SPI (ISP Lines), there are 3 spi lines
excluding rst,vcc,gnd. if we switch bluetooth uart to uart 1 (instead of 0) then
we could use the sck line as an extra...

LEDs

R 2.0V, 20mA  -> ~500ohms
G 3.2V, 20mA  -> ~440ohms
Y 2.0V, 20mA  -> ~500ohms
match appropriate led (color) with vcc level and led vf to get desired 20mA and
under resistor power rating.
